This project is called the Ladies List, the purpose of this design it to allow a digital space for task management system for a single user type.
This app will has a home page that shows after the user signs in. Once the user is logged on there will be a selection at the top right corner for “My Task”
when the user clicks my task they will be taken to a page where that have an empty text field where the user can input, and save their tasks they wish to complete. Along with the task feature the user will have an option for “my plans” this page will be a larger, or letter sized text box that allows users to plan out how they would like to exicute their task.

MVP features/User Stories:
User can log on with email User can interact with the home page complete with User can create unique task they wish to complete User can “delete” or complete task as they wish User can use “my plans” page to create plans of action for larger task

Helpful instructions on running the React App:


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
